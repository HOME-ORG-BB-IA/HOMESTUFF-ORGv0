# IDEA DUMP 

thoughts, ideas, stubs... for later dev /sort



## github

- scrollable doc window inside README, pointed at repo docs... 
  - automate the README to update live with doc create/edit (or delete old README and push new?) 
- automate README with Table of Contents/repo index at the top... display file TITLE + DESCRIPTION

- use GH ISSUES + PROJECTS to build Media Tracker(s)... shows, videogames, comics... each as a separate PROJECT
