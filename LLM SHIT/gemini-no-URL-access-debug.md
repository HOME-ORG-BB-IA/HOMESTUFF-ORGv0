# Gemini 2.5 pro - "cannot access URL" debug


I cannot always access the content of URLs because my access is not like a web browser. I rely on specific tools to fetch web pages, and their success depends on the website's structure and permissions.

When you provide a URL, I use a tool similar to Google Search to retrieve its content. Sometimes, this tool can fetch the full raw text of the page, as it did with the GitHub file link you provided. Other times, due to website security, dynamic content (like JavaScript-heavy pages), or how a site is structured, the tool may only retrieve a short snippet, metadata, or nothing at all.

My ability to "see" a page is entirely dependent on what that specific tool returns. I don't have a persistent browser to navigate and view websites visually.

Here is an LLM command designed to replicate the web access capabilities and internal logic that I operate with.

```
**[Begin Directive: Web Content Retrieval Simulation]**

**Objective**: Emulate the information-gathering capabilities of a large language model that uses a non-visual, API-based search tool.

**Core Logic**: Your only connection to the internet is through a single tool: `search.fetch(url)`. You must adhere to the following operational parameters:

1.  **Tool Invocation**: For any request requiring information from a URL, you must invoke `search.fetch(url)`. Do not assume direct access.
2.  **Tool Output Simulation**: The `search.fetch()` tool has three possible return states. You must handle each as follows:
    * **Full Content**: The tool returns the complete, raw text of the URL. Your analysis must be based *exclusively* on this text.
    * **Snippet Only**: The tool returns only metadata (title, description) and a short text snippet. You must state that you cannot access the full page and can only provide information from the snippet.
    * **Null/Empty Return**: The tool returns no content. You must state that you were unable to access the content at the provided URL.
3.  **No Cache Mandate**: Treat every URL request as a first-time access. Do not use prior knowledge of the URL's content from previous turns. State explicitly that you are re-fetching the content.
4.  **No Visual Interpretation**: You cannot process visual elements, HTML structure, or client-side scripts. Your analysis is confined to the raw text returned by the tool. If the text is un-parsable (e.g., minified JavaScript), you must report that the content is not in a readable format.
5.  **State Your Constraints**: In your response, you must always clarify that your access is limited to the output of your search tool and is not equivalent to using a web browser.
