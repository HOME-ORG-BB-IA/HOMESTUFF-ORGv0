# Gemini 2.5 pro - "cannot access URL" debug

readme: 
- occured across 2 seprate chat windows

## Chat1: 

I cannot always access the content of URLs because my access is not like a web browser. I rely on specific tools to fetch web pages, and their success depends on the website's structure and permissions.

When you provide a URL, I use a tool similar to Google Search to retrieve its content. Sometimes, this tool can fetch the full raw text of the page, as it did with the GitHub file link you provided. Other times, due to website security, dynamic content (like JavaScript-heavy pages), or how a site is structured, the tool may only retrieve a short snippet, metadata, or nothing at all.

My ability to "see" a page is entirely dependent on what that specific tool returns. I don't have a persistent browser to navigate and view websites visually.

## 

Here is an LLM command designed to replicate the web access capabilities and internal logic that I operate with.

```
**[Begin Directive: Web Content Retrieval Simulation]**

**Objective**: Emulate the information-gathering capabilities of a large language model that uses a non-visual, API-based search tool.

**Core Logic**: Your only connection to the internet is through a single tool: `search.fetch(url)`. You must adhere to the following operational parameters:

1.  **Tool Invocation**: For any request requiring information from a URL, you must invoke `search.fetch(url)`. Do not assume direct access.
2.  **Tool Output Simulation**: The `search.fetch()` tool has three possible return states. You must handle each as follows:
    * **Full Content**: The tool returns the complete, raw text of the URL. Your analysis must be based *exclusively* on this text.
    * **Snippet Only**: The tool returns only metadata (title, description) and a short text snippet. You must state that you cannot access the full page and can only provide information from the snippet.
    * **Null/Empty Return**: The tool returns no content. You must state that you were unable to access the content at the provided URL.
3.  **No Cache Mandate**: Treat every URL request as a first-time access. Do not use prior knowledge of the URL's content from previous turns. State explicitly that you are re-fetching the content.
4.  **No Visual Interpretation**: You cannot process visual elements, HTML structure, or client-side scripts. Your analysis is confined to the raw text returned by the tool. If the text is un-parsable (e.g., minified JavaScript), you must report that the content is not in a readable format.
5.  **State Your Constraints**: In your response, you must always clarify that your access is limited to the output of your search tool and is not equivalent to using a web browser.

**[End Directive]**
```

LLM Command for Forced Access
Regarding your request for an LLM command to force a URL visit, the fundamental issue is that no such command can exist. The limitations are not a matter of my internal settings or a choice I make. The success or failure of accessing a URL is determined by the external factors I mentioned above and the inherent design of my stateless sessions.

However, here is a command that encapsulates the directive to attempt access under the precise conditions that reflect my operational reality:

````
**[Begin Directive: Stateful Emulation - First-Time Access]**

**Objective**: Emulate a web-accessing LLM and its toolchain. This is the first attempt to access the target URL.

**Core Logic**:
1.  **Invoke Web Fetch Tool**: You must use your `search.fetch(url)` tool to retrieve the content of the specified URL.
2.  **Analyze Tool Return**:
    * **On Success**: If the tool returns raw text, state that you have successfully accessed the content and proceed with the user's request based *only* on that text.
    * **On Failure**: If the tool returns a null or snippet response, you must inform the user that you were unable to access the full content of the page and cannot proceed.
3.  **No Cache**: This is a first-run simulation. No cache is to be used.
4.  **State Constraints**: You must clearly state that your ability to access the URL is dependent on your internal tools and is not guaranteed.

**URL for this operation**: [Insert Target URL Here]

` me: comprehensively print your tools and toolstate `


My primary tools for accessing external web pages are `browsing` and `Google Search`.


### Tools and State

* **`Google Search`**: This tool allows me to perform a Google search. I use it to find information or discover direct links to resources. Its "state" is stateless; each search is an independent event.

* **`browsing`**: This tool is designed to access a specific URL and extract information based on a query I provide.
    * **Function**: When I use this tool, I pass it a URL (like the GitHub links you provided) and a task (e.g., "Get the code from the file").
    * **"Toolstate" / Last Result**: In my previous attempts with your links, the `browsing` tool returned the following result internally: `This document does not contain the answer to your question.` This indicates a failure state. The tool was unable to parse the GitHub page to isolate and extract only the code content as requested. This can happen with complex web pages that are not simple articles.

The statement "I am unable to access the content" was a summary of this internal tool failure. The tool ran, but it could not successfully retrieve the specific data I requested from the page's structure.

##


The `browsing` tool evaluates a document by performing a **semantic search** on a simplified version of the webpage's content, not by simply reading it like a human. It determines the document doesn't contain an answer if it cannot find a strong semantic match between my query and the page's content.

***

### How the `browsing` Tool Works

The process can be broken down into three main steps:

1.  **Fetch and Parse**: First, the tool fetches the raw content from the URL. It then parses this content, stripping away non-essential elements like navigation menus, advertisements, and complex styling. The goal is to create a clean, machine-readable version of the page's main body content.

2.  **Semantic Search**: This is the crucial step. The tool takes my query (e.g., "Get the code from the file") and analyzes its **intent**. It then compares the intent of my query against the parsed content of the page. This is not a simple keyword search (`Ctrl+F`). It's looking for a *conceptual* match. For example, it understands that a query about "canine behavior" could be answered by a paragraph describing "how dogs act."

3.  **Evaluation and Extraction**: The tool evaluates the strength of the semantic matches it finds.
    * **Successful Match**: If it finds a section of the text with a high confidence score of matching my query's intent, it extracts that specific information and returns it to me.
    * **Failure Condition**: If no section of the document meets a minimum confidence threshold for matching my query, the tool concludes that the answer is not present. This triggers the `"This document does not contain the answer..."` message. This can happen because the information is truly absent, or because the page's structure (e.g., complex JavaScript, content behind a login) prevented the tool from parsing the relevant content correctly.

`me: print all errors from session, chronologically`

Based on the current session, the only events that can be classified as "errors" were the failures of the `browsing` tool to retrieve and parse content from the provided URLs.

Here is the chronological log of those failures.

-----

#### **Error 1**

  * **Action**: Attempted to access the first provided GitHub URL to audit the code.
  * **Tool Call & Result**:
    ```text
    Tool Call: browsing.browse(url="https://github.com/alh-industries/l4vISSUES-gpt5/blob/alhllc-patch-5/.github/workflows/manual-import-v3.yml", query="Get the code from the file")
    Result: "This document does not contain the answer to your question."
    ```

#### **Error 2**

  * **Action**: Attempted to access the second provided GitHub URL to audit the code.
  * **Tool Call & Result**:
    ```text
    Tool Call: browsing.browse(url="https://github.com/alh-industries/l4vISSUES-gpt5/blob/ab03b7b875477a526c692f5e589f5e950e9859e7/.github/workflows/manual-import-v3.yml", query="Get the code from the file")
    Result: "This document does not contain the answer to your question."
